### **Defence Techniques for Various Scenarios**

If enemy1 is less than 130px or enemy2 is less than 130px distance then, take cover if wall1 or wall2 is less than 80px distance or engage in evasive manoeuvres or zigzag movements to reduce target predictability if wall1 or wall2 distance is more than 80px.

If the tank is less than 200 px away, then avoid direct confrontation and move behind large obstacles to block the line of sight. Call for aerial or anti-tank backup.

If either wall1 or wall2 is less than 80 px away then use the closest wall as cover, peeking only when necessary to fire or scout. Position yourself at corners to surprise advancing enemies.

If either wall1 or wall2 is more than 150 px away and enemy1 or enemy2 is less than 130 px away then stay low and move quickly to minimize time exposed in open areas. Keep moving to avoid being an easy target.
